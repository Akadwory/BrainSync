# BrainSync: Redefining Brain-Machine Interfaces

**Syncing neural signals to real-world impact with an advanced BMI pipeline.**

---

## Why BrainSync?

Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) promise to transform lives—restoring communication for the speechless, control for the immobile, and new frontiers for technology. Yet, today’s BMIs struggle with speed, accuracy, and real-world scalability. **BrainSync changes that.** We’re building a pipeline to decode neural signals faster and smarter, from EEG motor commands to ECoG speech, targeting real-time breakthroughs that bridge lab innovation to human impact.

## Current Phase

**Phase 1: EEG Motor Imagery Decoding**  
- **Dataset**: BCI Competition IV 2a (stored locally, not in repo)  
- **Approach**: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) + Transfer Learning  
- **Status**: In progress—laying a scalable foundation

## Roadmap

1. **EEG Pipeline (Weeks 1-3)**: Simulate real-time motor decoding with cutting-edge efficiency.  
2. **ECoG Speech Decoding (Weeks 4-6)**: Decode thoughts into words, targeting patient communication.  
3. **OpenBCI Integration (Phase 3)**: Bridge to live neural control with Ganglion hardware.

# BrainSync: Next-Gen Brain-Machine Interface

## Overview
BrainSync is an advanced brain-machine interface (BMI) project syncing neural signals with real-world actions to solve critical challenges in neural decoding. Starting with EEG motor imagery, we’ll scale to ECoG speech decoding and real-time OpenBCI integration—pushing the boundaries of speed, accuracy, and accessibility. Our aim: redefine BMI standards, unlocking new possibilities for patients and beyond.

## Current Phase
**Phase 1: EEG Motor Imagery Decoding**
- Dataset: BCI Competition IV 2a (stored locally, not in repo)
- Approach: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) + Transfer Learning
- Status: In progress—building a scalable foundation.

## Roadmap
1. EEG Pipeline (Weeks 1-3): Simulate real-time motor decoding with unprecedented efficiency.
2. ECoG Speech Decoding (Weeks 4-6): Restore communication by decoding thoughts into words.
3. OpenBCI Integration: Bridge lab to life with live neural control.

Stay synced—code, logs, and demos coming soon!

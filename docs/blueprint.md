# BrainSync Blueprint

## Problem
Neural decoding lags in speed and real-world impactâ€”patients lack fast, reliable communication; interfaces lack scalability.

## Solution
A next-gen BMI pipeline:
- **Phase 1**: EEG motor decoding with GNNs and transfer learning.
- **Phase 2**: ECoG speech decoding for thought-to-word translation.
- **Phase 3**: Real-time OpenBCI integration for live control.

## Tech Stack
- Python (`mne`, PyTorch)
- Graph Neural Networks + Transfer Learning
- AWS (S3 storage, ECS hosting), Docker

## Next Steps
- Simulate EEG streaming from BCI IV 2a.
